\section{Software and Hardware Resource Requirements}

The team intends to keep the technical environment simple and manageable to ensure successful project completion. Development, testing, and deployment will be performed using software installed on student laptops, with GitHub serving as the primary configuration management and CI/CD platform. The database will be lightweight, likely requiring one or two tables to store AQI data, and the use of cloud services may not be necessary. As a contingency measure, the team is also considering recording a demonstration video to document system functionality.

\subsection*{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python} --- chosen for its accessibility and the team’s proficiency.
    \item \textbf{SQLite Database} --- lightweight and sufficient for the project’s data storage needs.
    \item \textbf{GitHub (CI/CD)} --- for version control, integration, and deployment management.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Student laptops} --- used for development, testing, and deployment activities.
