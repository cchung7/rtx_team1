\section{Project Organization}

Team 1 (Raytheon Group A) currently consists of six software engineers working together as a single group. This structure is intended as a temporary arrangement until the project workload can be better assessed. Since the number and complexity of modules will not be clear until detailed requirements are established, maintaining one unified team at this stage supports flexibility and adaptability. Once the architecture and design are sufficiently defined, the team will be able to divide responsibilities more effectively by forming subgroups aligned with specific modules or tasks. In the meantime, working as one group encourages communication and collaboration, ensuring that all members remain aligned during the early phases of the project.
