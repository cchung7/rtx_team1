\section{Introduction}

This document presents the Project Management Plan (PMP) for the development of the \textbf{City Level Air Quality Prediction (CLAP) Application}. Its purpose is to outline how the system will be designed, developed, and deployed, while also defining the processes and responsibilities that will guide the project. The scope of the document includes the structure, design, and management activities required to complete the CLAP system.

The CLAP system is a predictive analytics application that forecasts future Air Quality Index (AQI) categories for a single U.S. city using historical AQI and weather data from the National Weather Service (NWS). In addition to serving as a proof of concept, CLAP can also function as an educational tool for students interested in building similar applications. By leveraging available data, the system may help anticipate air quality and related weather trends, offering insights that could support awareness and decision-making.
