\section{Lifecycle Model Used}

The team has adopted an \textbf{iterative lifecycle model} to guide project development. This model emphasizes repeated cycles of design, implementation, and feedback, allowing the system to be refined and improved over time. Iteration provides opportunities for early validation of functionality and helps ensure that the system evolves in alignment with stakeholder expectations. This approach is well-suited for a proof-of-concept project, as it enables the team to demonstrate core capabilities early while progressively addressing non-functional requirements (e.g., usability, performance, and reliability).
