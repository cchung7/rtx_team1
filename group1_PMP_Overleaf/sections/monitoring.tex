\section{Monitoring, Reporting, and Controlling Mechanisms}

Project monitoring will be achieved through a combination of weekly reports, sponsor communication, and version control practices. Weekly attendance reports will document participation in progress meetings and be submitted each Friday, while weekly sponsor reports will ensure consistent communication and alignment with project expectations. GitHub will be used for version control and configuration management to track progress on documents and code. Weekly status reports will further support scheduling and the timely completion of milestones, helping the team meet important deadlines and maintain accountability.
